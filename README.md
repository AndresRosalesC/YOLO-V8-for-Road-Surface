This project uses YOLOv8 to classify dashboard images and classify the road according to its winter conditions, i.e. bare road vs snowy/icy road

This project is setup to be used on Google Colab using Google Drive
Put all training, test, and validation images in a folder called data with their respective annotations

It should work on a free Google Colab account with an accuracy of over 99%, used with images containing bare roads and snow/ice- covered roads
